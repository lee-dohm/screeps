# Ideas for later

This is where I'm collecting links or general thoughts that need other things to be cleared out of the way before I begin working on them.

## Testing

Because of how interdependent everything is in AI development, almost everything is a huge rewrite, even with what would traditionally be considered well-factored code. Huge rewrites without tests make me very, very nervous. So I would really like to remedy this and get some tests built around my framework as it grows.

## TypeScript

I tried building my codebase with TypeScript but the code that I had originally depended a bit too much on fully dynamic types. I eventually ran into a brick wall on getting things to work with the type system and ripped it all out. With how interdependent everything is, I'd really like to get back to using TypeScript at some later point.
